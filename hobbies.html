          <p>I've had the opportunity to work in various exciting internships:</p>
      
          <div class="internship">
              <strong>Summer Undergraduate Research Intern</strong><br>
              The University of Wisconsin – Madison, Water Science and Engineering Laboratory, Madison, WI<br>
              June 2023 – August 2023<br>
              <p>During this internship, I developed Python scripts to automate data processing and analysis of water contamination trends in the Midwestern Cambrian-Ordovician Aquifer System using publicly available data. I conducted Theil-Sen regression and Linear regression analyses in R, which revealed concerning trends in water contamination across the aquifer system. Additionally, I utilized QGIS for data visualization and mapping, emphasizing the importance of continuous monitoring and addressing public health concerns related to water pollutants.</p>

          <div class="internship">
              <strong>Project Management Intern</strong><br>
              NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory – Information Technology Support Directorate, Pasadena, CA<br>
              June 2022 – October 2022<br>
              <p>During my internship at NASA JPL, I played a key role in improving communications by implementing a content management system using Python and Django. Working with a team of 6 engineers, we designed a digital signage interface for various organizations, enhancing their ability to manage and display information to 6,000 employees and visitors. I also implemented and maintained 30 new digital signage appliances, ensuring smooth and effective communication and addressing issues that were affecting the performance of previous appliances. Additionally, I collaborated with the IT team to develop monitoring scripts using PowerShell, which improved proactive issue identification and reduced downtime.</p>

          <div class="internship">
              <strong>United States Department of Defense Software Engineer Intern</strong><br>
              White Sands Missile Range – Software and Data Analysis Branch, White Sands, NM<br>
              June 2021 – August 2021<br>
              <p>During my internship with the U.S. Department of Defense, I conducted verification and validation testing to enhance the reliability of defense system software. Collaborating with a team of 10+ engineers and interns, we developed an intuitive graphical user interface application using C++, leading to improvements and enhanced functionality for defense system software. I also contributed to improving the efficiency of outdated code by refactoring it, thereby enhancing the maintainability and scalability of defense system software.</p>
